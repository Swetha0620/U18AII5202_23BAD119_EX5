## Interactive Analytical Dashboard Design

**Name:** Swetha P  
**Roll Number:** 23BAD119  

---

## Objective

To design an interactive analytical dashboard for monitoring key academic metrics.

---


## Project Overview

This experiment focuses on designing an interactive analytical dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard presents key performance indicators (KPIs) and interactive visualizations to analyze attendance and academic performance across departments and semesters. It enables real-time interaction and deeper insight through filters and drill-down features.

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains academic information related to students and departments, including:

- Department  
- Semester  
- Attendance percentage  
- Academic performance metrics  

The data is used to compute KPIs and generate visual insights for smart campus monitoring.

## Software and Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop**  
- **Data Visualization and Dashboard Design Tools (Power BI)**  

---

## In-Lab Tasks Performed

- Designed KPI cards to display:
  - Average Attendance Percentage  
  - Average Academic Performance  
- Implemented interactive slicers for:
  - Department-wise filtering  
  - Semester-wise filtering  
- Created bar charts to visualize attendance by department.  
- Linked multiple visuals to enable drill-down analysis.  
- Ensured all visuals update dynamically based on user selections.
